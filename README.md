# custom-hack-next-app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It is a boilerplate for [CustomHack](https://lu.ma/rnvz7h05).

**tl;dr** [click here to deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flingodotdev%2Fcustom-hack-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies via a package manager (we prefer [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Next run the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Setting up env variables

You need to create and use your own accounts and setup env variables for your project. It is up to you how you do this:

1. put them in `.env` file of your project. See `env.example` for a full list of env vars. Next.js loads them automatically for you.

2. export them globally (eg. `export LINGODOTDEV_API_KEY=api_xxx`) in your shell or profile (eg. `~/.profile`)

## Deploy on Vercel
